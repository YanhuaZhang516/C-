- [ ] Integer Types

Computer memory consists of units called **bits**. Short, int, long and long long can represent up to four different **integer width**.

A byte usually means an 8-bit unit of memory.
- *short*: 16 bits (2 bytes)
- *int*: at least as big as *short* (usually 4 bytes)
- *long*: at least 32 bits and at least as big as *int* 
- *long long*: at least 64 bits and at least as big as *long*

这些数也包含负数，所以比如说对于16bits的short类型数，它的范围是（-2^8 ~2^8), 而对于 unsigned 类型，则数值范围为 （0 ~ 2^16)
